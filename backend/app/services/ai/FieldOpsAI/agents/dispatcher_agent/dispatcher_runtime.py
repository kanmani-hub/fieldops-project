"""
dispatcher_runtime.py

Runtime integration for the FieldOps Dispatcher Agent.

Responsibilities:
- Load real jobs from the database.
- Preserve the complete ranked technician pool.
- Preserve the complete ranked eligible technician pool.
- Broadcast an offer to every eligible technician concurrently.
- Let the database atomically select the first accepting technician.
- Wait for every offer to become terminal before replanning.

Important:
- This file does NOT use the manual assignment endpoint.
- Broadcast offer coordination is persisted in Job.dispatch_state.
- Database/service layer owns operational side effects.
